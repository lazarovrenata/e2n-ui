# e2n design system

> This UI components are currently in beta.

### Our vision
We at E2N want to transform the design guidelines and identity of our brand into unique and beautiful UI components. With this, we want to create a software the reflects our brand and experience for our users. To achieve this, we have been working in a small team for several months to build our own design system and component library with React.

### Get started
[Here](https://ui.e2n.dev) you can explore the current status of our component library.

The state of the library is work-in-progress. We are still working on the development of an optimal workflow to bring our Figma templates and code closer together. Feel free to contribute if you are interested in this topic.

Run the following command to start Storybook and inspect the components locally:
```
yarn storybook
```
